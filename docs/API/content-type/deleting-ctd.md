# Deleting Content Types

Existing <abbr title="Content Type - a model of data that has been defined inside the Content Repository.">Content
Type</abbr>
can be deleted either by sending a properly formatted `DELETE` request to the ``/api/v1/internal/contenttype/{name}``
endpoint or through the Content Modeler tool provided with the platform.

!!! note
    You will need to use your `Application Read and write API KEY` to perform this action. Read more about [API keys and scoped API keys](/docs/API/).


## Deleting Content Types via API

Deleting <abbr title="Content Type - a model of data that has been defined inside the Content Repository.">
Content Type</abbr> is simply a ``DELETE`` call without a payload.

You can only delete Content Types that do not have any Content Objects or are not assigned to the scoped API key.


!!! Example

    === "CURL"
    
        ```
        curl --location --request DELETE "https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/internal/contenttype/blogposts" \
        --header 'accept: */*' \
        --header 'X-AUTH-TOKEN: YOUR_API_KEY'
        ```
        { data-search-exclude }

    === "C# + Restasharp"

        ```
        var client = new RestClient("https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/internal/contenttype/blogposts");
        var request = new RestRequest(Method.DELETE);
        request.AddHeader("X-AUTH-TOKEN", "YOUR_API_KEY");
        IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
        ```
        { data-search-exclude }
    
    === "Go + Native"

        ```
        package main

        import (
            "fmt"

            "io/ioutil"

        func main() {
        
            url := "https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/internal/contenttype/blogposts"
        
            req, _ := http.NewRequest("DELETE", url, nil)

            req.Header.Add("X-AUTH-TOKEN", "YOUR_API_KEY")
        
            res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
        
            defer res.Body.Close()
            body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
        
            fmt.Println(res)
            fmt.Println(string(body))
        
        }

        Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
        ```
        { data-search-exclude }
