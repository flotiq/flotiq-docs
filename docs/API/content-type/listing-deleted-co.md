# Listing ids of deleted Content Objects

Once a <abbr title="Content Type - a model of data that has been defined inside the Content Repository.">Content Type</abbr>
has been defined in the system - the user can list ids of removed objects
<abbr title="Content Object - an instance of a Content Type.">Content Objects</abbr> of that Content Type.

!!! note
    You have to use your `Application Read and write API KEY` to perform this action
    or `User API KEY` scoped to accept read and delete on the Content Type you wish to list.
    Read more about [API keys and scoped API keys](/docs/API/).

## Listing ids of deleted Content Objects through API

To list ids of the deleted Content Objects, you use the `/api/v1/content/{name}/removed` endpoint
(where `name` is the name of the content type definition).
It lists all of the deleted Content Objects of the Content Type.
You can filter Content Objects using the `deletedAfter` query parameter
containing the date after which the Content Objects were deleted; the date must be in the format accepted by the [DateTime::format](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php) function.


!!! Example

    === "CURL"

        ```
        curl --location --request GET "https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/content/blogposts/removed?deletedAfter=2020-06-17%2009:00:00" \
        --header "accept: application/json" \
        --header "X-AUTH-TOKEN: YOUR_API_TOKEN"
        ``` 
        { data-search-exclude }

    === "C# + Restasharp"

        ```
        var client = new RestClient("https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/content/blogposts/removed");
        var request = new RestRequest(Method.GET);
        request.AddHeader("X-AUTH-TOKEN", "YOUR_API_KEY");
        IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
        ```
        { data-search-exclude }
    
    === "Go + Native"

        ```
        package main

            url := "https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/content/blogposts/removed"
        
            req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)
        
            req.Header.Add("X-AUTH-TOKEN", "YOUR_API_KEY")
        
            res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
        
            defer res.Body.Close()
            body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
        
            fmt.Println(res)
            fmt.Println(string(body))
            
        }

        .addHeader("X-AUTH-TOKEN", "YOUR_API_KEY")
        .build();
        
        Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
        ```
        { data-search-exclude }

    === "Java + Unirest"
      
        ```
        HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.get("https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/content/blogposts/removed")
            .header("X-AUTH-TOKEN", "YOUR_API_KEY")
