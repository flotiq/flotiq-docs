title: Generate Package - SDK NodeJS
description: Flotiq provides SDK NodeJS to access your Content.

# SDK NodeJS

## Download a package

On your Flotiq dashboard, you can find link to download client library SDK NodeJS.

![Available frameworks and languages](../images/frameworkslogos-nodejs.png){: .width25 .center .border}

These package is automatically generated every time you modify your Content Type definitions, just like your API documentation.

### 1. Installation

To use SDK in your project follow below steps:

1. Unzip and move this package to `[projectDirectory]/flotiq-javascript-sdk/`
2. In your `[projectDirectory]/flotiq-javascript-sdk/` run `npm i && npm run build`
3. In your `[projectDirectory]` run `npm i ./flotiq-javascript-sdk --save`

Possibly you would have to add `--legacy-peer-deps` to your commands, if you get plugin versions error.

_Other installation methods are described in [Additional usage methods](#additional-usage-methods) section._

### 2. Configure your SDK

To initialize SDK we will use `FlotiqUserApi.ApiClient.init` method, which requires to provide the `API_KEY` value.

Your Flotiq API_KEY is located in the [Flotiq Dashboard](https://editor.flotiq.com).
If you need more directions go to the [docs](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/).

You can create empty file, where you put code with your configuration and requests, such as `app.js`

```javascript
const FlotiqUserApi = require("flotiq_user_api");
FlotiqUserApi.ApiClient.init("API_KEY");
```
{ data-search-exclude }

### 3. Make requests to the Flotiq

```javascript
let api = new FlotiqUserApi.ContentBlogAuthorApi();
let opts = {
  page: "1", // {Number} Listing page number, 1-based
  limit: "20", // {Number} Page limit
  orderBy: "internal.updatedAt", // {String} Order by field
  orderDirection: "asc", // {String} Order direction
  hydrate: "0", // {Number} Should hydrate relations of object, for now only two levels of hydration are possible
  filters:
    '{"slug":{"type":"contains","filter":"test"},"title":{"type":"contains","filter":"test"}}', // {String} List filters
  ids: '["null"]', // {[String]} Ids of objects to return.
};
api.listFlotiqblogauthor(opts).then(
  function (data) {
    console.log("API called successfully. Returned data: ", data);
  },
  function (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
);
```
{ data-search-exclude }

Code above is just an example - you should copy code from `docs` folder in your sdk.

To call the code lets just use: 


```
node app.js

```
{ data-search-exclude }


### 4. SDK NodeJS common use cases

The Main concept of Flotiq is that your API Specification represents your set of content definitions literally.

Can be use:

- SearchApi: The Flotiq API provides a powerful search engine, which is a wrapper for ElasticSearch queries.
- MediaApi: Endpoint for upload or get media files.
- InternalApi: Returns, delete or create an user-defined Content Definitions
- GraphQlApi: Endpoint for GraphQL Queries for Headless Types
- Content...Api: Endpoints for automatically generated Content Type definitions

## Additional usage methods

### Local development

You can also use this package as local dependency.
To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry or committing to the repository, first install the dependencies
by changing into the directory containing package.json (and this README). Let's call this JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```
{ data-search-exclude }

Next, link it globally in npm with the following, also from JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR:

```shell
npm link
```
{ data-search-exclude }

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your flotiq_user_api from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```
{ data-search-exclude }

Finally, you need to build the module:

```
npm run build
```
{ data-search-exclude }
