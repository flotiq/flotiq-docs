# Flotiq CLI

## Overview

We've prepared Flotiq CLI (command-line interface) to help launch and manage Flotiq projects more efficiently using Flotiq's blazing-fast API.

It allows for many actions for your Flotiq account management, like automatically starting one of our Gatsby or NextJs starters, importing data from a third-party service or programs like excel or WordPress and much more.

## Installation

!!! Warning
       You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 9 or higher to install and use Flotiq CLI.

To install Flotiq CLI globally use the following command in the terminal of your choosing:

```bash
npm install -g flotiq-cli
```
{ data-search-exclude }

## Usage

Flotiq CLI currently supports the following commands:

* `flotiq purge` purges your account of all Content Objects data (if you want to purge data from your account after testing different imports). (more on `flotiq purge` [here](./purge.md))
