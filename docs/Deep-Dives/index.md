description: Browse through the deep dives and learn how to integrate Flotiq in your application.

# Introduction

This section contains several walk-throughs that will help you get familiar with Flotiq with a specific use case.

1. Start with the [Flotiq Starter - NextJS project](/docs/CLI/starting-new-project-nextjs.md) article. You will get a good introduction to the most important parts of the system, yet the tutorial is very simple and you'll quickly end up with a live site, without writing a line of code.
2. Once you're comfortable with Flotiq - go through the [Importing posts from Wordpress](wordpress-import.md) tutorial. This will get you familiar with your own Flotiq SDKs and will show you how to quickly migrate content from Wordpress to Flotiq.

We can't wait to see what you'll build!
