## Signing in to Netlify

If you do not have the Netlify account, the easiest way to create an account and use it in this tutorial will be to use **GitHub** on the Netlify sign-up page.
Netlify will ask you to authorize with your GitHub account. If you need to request access to one or more repositories, you can click **request access** here or later when creating an instance.

## Deployment

Once you’ve configured your account, select a platform where your project repository is; in this tutorial, we are using GitHub.

 ![](images/netlify-select-source.png){: .center .width75 .border}

You might need to approve the access to your GitHub repositories. 

Then select the repository that contains your project.

 ![](images/netlify-nextjs-select-repository.png){: .center .width75 .border}

After selecting the repository, you can specify a name for your site, base directory, build command, and environmental variables.\nAs our project is in the repository’s root, the base directory remains empty.

In this example, we need to specify two environment variables: **FLOTIQ_API_URL** and **FLOTIQ_API_KEY**.

If you need to add some more, just click on **New variable**.

For more information about environment variables, check [this section](#setting-up-environment-variables)

If everything looks fine, click on the Deploy button and wait for Netlify to deploy your project.

After a while, you should see a notification, that your deployment succeeded. ![](images/netlify-nextjs-deployment-success.png){: .center .width75 .border}

After clicking on **View site deploy** button, you’ll be taken to the project’s management site on Netlify, and from there, you can click to view your site, just click **Open production deploy**: ![](images/netlify-nextjs-deployment-publish.png){: .center .width75 .border}

Congratulations, you’ve successfully deployed your Flotiq-based site on Netlify!

### Setting up Environment Variables

An environment variable references a value that can affect how running processes will behave on a computer, for example, in staging and production environments. You must save environment variables in Netlify to authorize your instance to pull source data from Flotiq.

The essential two environment variables needed for every Gatsby project are **FLOTIQ_API_KEY** and **FLOTIQ_API_URL**. In some cases, you will provide additional environmental variables for your application to work.

For example, if you're using the [Gatsby and Snipcart starter](https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-products) you will also provide the Snipcart API key. The project Readme always described the needed variables.

To obtain the Flotiq API key - in your Flotiq account, click `API keys` in the sidebar:

 ![](../../API/images/api-keys-menu.png){: .center .width25 .border}

You can either select the application-wide read-only key:

 ![](../../API/images/api-keys_1.png){: .center .width75 .border}

Or, as a safer option, create a scoped read-only API key that will only be used for the Netlify build. Read more about [Flotiq API access](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/).

Copy the Read-Only key and paste it into Netlify settings as **FLOTIQ_API_KEY**. For the **FLOTIQ_API_URL** put **https://api.flotiq.com**.

!!! Note

    Flotiq doesn't enforce any particular way of selecting drafts or non-public versions of your pages. The Read-Only key you copied will give you access to all your content. If you'd like to set up draft and public versions of your pages - you can do so by adding an extra field to your content types and querying for it in your GraphQL queries.

    ## Installing the Netlify plugin

    Flotiq Netlify plugin allows you to trigger Netlifly builds within Content Objects forms. You will also be able to quickly navigate to your Netlify pages from the Flotiq content editor.
