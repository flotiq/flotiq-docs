# Flotiq Universe

You can jump-start your projects a lot faster thanks to integrations and starters provided by Flotiq.

As Postman recently introduced Public Workspaces, we could show our sandbox API schemas to the broad public; you can learn more about it on [Postman doc page](postman.md).

Thanks to Zapier integrations, you can quickly rebuild your static site every time content creator adds or change the content in Flotiq, learn more about it [here](zapier.md).

You can jump-start your JAMStack projects using our [Gatsby](gatsby.md) (React), [Next.js](nextjs.md) (React) or [Scully](scully.md) (Angular) starters of static pages generators.
