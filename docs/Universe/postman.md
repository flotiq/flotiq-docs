# Postman Sandbox Packages

Flotiq provides Sandbox Postman Packages through Postman Public Workspaces you can see them all on [Postman Flotiq team page](https://www.postman.com/flotiq).

We provide demo packages for:

You can try it all by forking the API to your Postman account:

You have to specify the name of the collection, and to which workspace it should land when all is in place:

After clicking `Fork Collection` if your profile is not yet public, you have to make it public by clicking `Make Profile Public`:

Now you should have our Sandbox Package available to send requests from Postman page or from Postman app:

!!! warning
    We provide Read-Only API key in our Sandbox Packages, so only `GET` and `GraphQL` requests will work, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` request will all return `403 Unauthorized` response.

!!! hint
