# Content Objects

Once a Content Type has been defined in the system - the user can create Content Objects of that Content Type.
This is done either directly through the API or via the convenient Content Entry tools
provided within the [Flotiq Dashboard](https://editor.flotiq.com){:target="_blank"}.

The Content Entry component consists of two elements - the content browser and the content editor.

Click tile on the Type Definitions to go to the content browser page:

or entry in the left menu:

The content browser provides a convenient grid interface to browse and search through large amounts of data quickly.
Users can customize the grid according to their preferences:

From the grid, the users can go to the form that allows them to edit particular Content Objects:
